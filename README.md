# COMP3000Project - VR Commander
This is the repo for my final year project VR Commander, a Virtual Reality Real Time Strategy game which has base mechanics of base building and unit control as well as some basic enemy AI.

players take control of a blue team of units. Players can use the grab button on an Oculus controller to pick a unit, then use the trigger to select a location on the terrain to send that unit. Units will attack enemy structures and enemy units when they are within range.
